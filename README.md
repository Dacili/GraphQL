If you want first to check readme about **React** check this link https://github.com/Dacili/GraphQL/blob/master/GraphQLwithReact/GraphQLwithReact/ClientApp/src/README.md

## About app
Application is created using **React 18** for the frontend part, and **.Net Core .NET 7** for the backend.  
**Rsuite** UI library is used for components.   
- Url for the frontend is: https://localhost:44419/  
- for the backend https://localhost:7277/  
- for the Graph QL https://localhost:7277/graphql/   


# GraphQL
Is a query language for API.  
-*Over-fetching:* you get more data than you actually need.  
Ex: you have object of 30 properties. For the specific UI, you only need Id, and Name of that object. So instead of getting only that 2 properties, you get 30.  
-*Under-fetching:* you get less data than you actually need. Opposite of over-fetching.  
GraphQL gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need so they can avoid over-fetching or under-fetching.

# GraphQL vs REST
- While typical REST APIs require loading from multiple URLs, GraphQL APIs get all the data your app needs in a single request (you can nest queries, or mutations in 1 request).   
- With GraphQL we're avoiding over-fetching or under-fetching (it's very good for mobile), in REST we would have to create different APIs to cover all needs.  
- REST is more established and enjoys widespread support. Itâ€™s easier to find more tools, integration, and infrastructure for a more specialized project.
